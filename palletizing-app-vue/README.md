## About this project,

Tried for first time, separated pages in multiple components but further breaking would take more time hence submitting as much as i could do in given time.

## how to run

do `yarn install` then `yarn serve`. (npm was giving some error while creating vue app, so used yarn)

# More about the assignment is mentioned in the Readme file of angular project.
